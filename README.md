# Arduino-DTMF-relay-control
This project lets you remotely control a relay using DTMF tones from any phone. By calling the system and pressing keys (e.g., 2 to turn ON, 3 to turn OFF), the Arduino reads the DTMF input via an MT8870 decoder and switches a relay. Ideal for controlling appliances like lights or pumps without internet.
