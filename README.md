# Arduino-DTMF-relay-control
ðŸ“± DTMF Relay Control Using Phone and Arduino
This project allows you to remotely control a relay using DTMF tones from any mobile phone. When you call the phone connected to the system and press specific keys (e.g., 2 to turn ON, 3 to turn OFF), the Arduino reads the DTMF signals via an MT8870 decoder and controls a relay accordingly. Itâ€™s useful for automating electrical devices like lights, pumps, or other appliances over a simple phone call â€” no internet required.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Control a relay remotely using a mobile phone

Press 2 to turn ON the relay

Press 3 to turn OFF the relay

Uses MT8870 DTMF decoder with Arduino

No internet or smartphone needed â€” works with any basic GSM phone

ðŸ§° Components:
Arduino UNO

MT8870 DTMF decoder module

Relay module

GSM phone or module with auto-answer

Jumper wires and power supply

ðŸ”— How It Works:
Call the system-connected phone.

Press 2 to activate the relay.

Press 3 to deactivate the relay.

Arduino decodes the tone using MT8870 and triggers relay based on input.
